# Very Simple Malware Detector


## Objective

This repository contains the intermediate project for the [ML Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code) course provided by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).


## Context



## Dataset



### Deployment

The MLOps pipeline is fully dockerised and can be easily deployed via the following steps:

1. Clone the `very-simple-malware-detector` repository locally:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Peco602/very-simple-malware-detector.git
    ```

2. Install the pre-requisites necessary to run the pipeline:

    ```bash
    $ cd very-simple-malware-detector
    $ sudo apt install make
    $ make prerequisites
    ```

    It is also suggested to add the current user to the `docker` group to avoid running the next steps as `sudo`:

    ```bash
    $ sudo groupadd docker
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

    then, logout and log back in so that the group membership is re-evaluated.

3. [*Optional*] Configure the development evironment:

    ```bash
    $ make setup
    ```

    This is required to perform further development and testing on the pipeline.

4. Pull the Docker images:

    ```
    $ make pull
    ```

5. Launch the service:

    ```
    $ make run
    ```

### Training



### Testing


```bash
curl -F "sample=@./data/nslookup.exe" localhost:8080/predict
curl -F "sample=@./data/ping.exe" localhost:8080/predict
curl -F "sample=@./data/Bonzify.exe" localhost:8080/predict
```

### Disposal

The service can be disposed via:

```
$ make kill
```


## GitHub Actions

- **Continuous Integration**: On every push and pull request on `main` and `dev` branches, the Docker images are built, tested and then pushed to DockerHub.
